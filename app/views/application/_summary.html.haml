  I am working on a game, a first-person RPG for
  iOS, set in ancient Greece, called Laertes, using OpenGL ES 2.0. You can see some

  In fact, the 3-D rendering software in cpyn comes from Laertes.
  Meanwhile,
  I also have to pay my bills, and I have
  many skills. I spent a lot of time in academic physics and working on Wall St.,
  doing high-performance server work. The cpyn audio buffering software leverages
  and builds on that experience, down to custom, lightweight C++ synchronization
  primitives that are much faster than mutexes.

  I have been writing C++ for more than twenty years and have reached a very high level of
  competence. I am proficient with a number of other languages, like C, Java, Ruby,
  JavaScript, Swift and Objective-C. I have done tons of system programming, mostly in C and C++,
  and I am very
  comfortable doing server development. I also do a lot of UI development in
  Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Swift, Objective-C and GLSL, which I enjoy. In addition, I have in recent
  years developed an interest in automation, particularly testing automation, and
  security (SSL, encryption, Tor and anonymity, and so on). At times I have been a
  writer, and I am known for scrupulously documenting
  my software work. I have an addiction to human languages, which have received a lot of
  my attention over the years.

  I can do quite a few things. Please get in touch if you are interested in engaging me.
