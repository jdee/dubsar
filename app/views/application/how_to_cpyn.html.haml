%h2#choosing Choosing something to cpyn

%p
  When you first start the app, there is a large, wide button above the turntable that
  is either labeled
  %em library
  or with the name of your current track. Tap that button. It will immediately change to
  say
  %em - loading library -.

=image_tag 'cpyn-overhead.png', size: "280x497", alt: "cpyn overhead view", style: 'display: block; margin-left: 20pt;'

%p
  After a few seconds, a modal view will appear with your iPod library.

=image_tag 'ipod-library.png', size: "280x497", alt: "iPod library", style: 'display: block; margin-left: 20pt;'

%p
  Select any track(s) from your iPod library and tap done. The library view will go away and
  return you to the turntable, which should now be playing.

%h2#equalizer The Equalizer

%p
  With the turntable showing, swipe to the left to show equalization options.

=image_tag 'cpyn_equalizer.png', size: "280x497", alt: "cpyn equalizer", style: 'display: block; margin-left: 20pt;'

%p
  A button at the bottom shows which equalizer preset you are currently using. Tap the button
  to see a list of presets. The setting starts out Custom, which enables the graphic equalizer.
  If you select any other preset, the graphic equalizer will be disabled; the sliders will all
  be gray. Adjust the sliders with Custom selected to choose a nonstandard equalizer setting.
%p
  This view includes a frequency analyzer that shows the relative power distribution per
  band while the audio plays.

%h2#q_button Q button

%p
  There is a button marked Q in the upper lefthand corner of the view. This simply displays your
  current queue.

=image_tag 'cpyn-queue.png', size: "280x497", alt: "cpyn queue", style: 'display: block; margin-left: 20pt;'

%p
  You can immediately advance to play any track in your queue by tapping that row.

%p
  Here you find the repeat and shuffle mode settings. You can also manually edit your
  queue here, skipping any tracks you&apos;d prefer not to hear and reordering them
  by dragging them around.

= image_tag 'cpyn-queue-edit.png', size: "280x497", alt: "cpyn queue editing", style: "display: block; margin-left: 20pt;"

%p
  After reordering your queue manually or by choosing a shuffle mode, you can use the
  Reset button to undo all changes and return to your original queue.

%p
  Use the + button here to add new tracks from your library to the end of your queue,
  even while it&apos;s playing. This first undoes any changes to your queue. If you
  have a shuffle mode selected, they will be reshuffled.

%h2#playback Playback

%p
  You can freely skip tracks forward and backward during playback or while paused.
  The button in the middle below the turntable changes from a play button to a pause
  button. Use it to toggle playback. The counter above the iTunes button will show
  the current playback time and the total track length.

%h2#background Background and remote control

%p
  The app can play in the background and with the screen locked. You can use the remote
  control functions in the lock screen, in the now-playing controls in the control center
  and on your earphones to pause, play and skip tracks.

%h2#scratching Scratching

%p
  You can scratch records by rotating the turntable back and forth with one finger.
  More than one finger cancels the gesture and returns to whatever playback direction
  and speed you currently have set. The music player adjusts the direction and playback
  rate to match your gesture. It can switch directions up to 4 times per second.

%h2#headers Header views

%p
  There is an arrow button above the turntable pointing down. Tap it to reveal the
  header view, a region at the top of the screen that contains controls and other
  information, while the turntable view is reclined.
%p
  Each header view has an edge grip consisting of three vertically-arranged gray dots
  on the left or right side indicating the presence of another header view on that
  side. Swipe left from the right side or right from the left side wherever you see
  a grip to slide to the next header view.
%p
  There are six header view panes, discussed below.

%h3#volume_view Volume view

%p
  The first header view you will see is the volume view.

=image_tag 'cpyn-volume-view.png', size: "280x156", alt: 'cpyn mixer view', style: 'display: block; margin-left: 20pt;'

%p
  Here you can adjust the device volume and choose AirPlay routes. You can also adjust
  the stereo balance and playback direction here. You can freely switch directions
  while playing. You can even play your entire queue in reverse, repeating and cross
  fading as you go.

%p
  To the left of the volume view are several views that have no controls and present
  only information. Swipe right from the left side of the header view to see the header
  view to the left.

%h3#wave_form Wave form

%p
  The first header view you will see to the left shows you the live wave form being read 
  from the MP3 or other audio file and played. What you see is a time slice of about 46 ms.

=image_tag 'cpyn-wave-form-view.png', size: "280x156", alt: 'cpyn wave form view', style: 'display: block; margin-left: 20pt;'

%h3#now_playing Now-playing view

%p
  The next header view you will see to the left is the now-playing view.

=image_tag 'cpyn-now-playing.png', size: "280x156", alt: 'cpyn now-playing view', style: 'display: block; margin-left: 20pt;'

%p
  This view shows the artist, the album the track is from, the track index on that album,
  the track name, the publication date, the total track time and the composer where available.

%h3#audio_detail Audio-detail view

%p
  The last view to the left of the volume view shows audio format details of the now-playing
  track.

=image_tag 'cpyn-audio-detail.png', size: "280x156", alt: 'cpyn audio detail view', style: 'display: block; margin-left: 20pt;'

%h3#audio_settings Audio settings

%p
  The first view to the right of the volume view lets you adjust the playback rate and
  track delay.

=image_tag 'cpyn-playback-rate-view.png', size: "280x156", alt: 'cpyn mixer view', style: 'display: block; margin-left: 20pt;'

%p
  Playback rate ranges from 1/4 x to 4 x. The pitch changes with the rate. Any deviation from
  1.0 is very noticeable. Tap the 1.0 button above the knob to restore it to exactly 1.0.
%p
  Track delay is the delay between tracks. Playback is ordinarily gapless. You can adjust the
  gap to be up to 4 seconds. Set it to a negative value to cross fade tracks. This setting
  is also available in the Settings app. Tap the 0 above the knob to return to gapless playback.

%h3#turntable_speed Turntable speed

%p
  The next view to the right lets you adjust the turntable speed.

=image_tag 'cpyn-options-view.png', size: "280x156", alt: 'cpyn mixer view', style: 'display: block; margin-left: 20pt;'

%p
  You can adjust the rotation speed of the turntable to either 33 or 45 r.p.m. You can also
  disable the rotation altogether if you prefer.

%h3#light_controls Light controls

%p
  This view provides controls to adjust the light over the turntable.

=image_tag 'cpyn-light-controls.png', size: "280x156", alt: 'cpyn light controls', style: 'display: block; margin-left: 20pt;'

%p
  You can directly adjust the red, green and blue components of the light as well as its position
  in a plane above the turntable. You can also enable autolighting and let the accelerometers
  on the device do the work. The light will change position to appear always to be overhead.

%p
  All the knobs in these views can be configured to respond to one of two gestures: a
  one-finger rotation gesture (just drag your finger around the surface of the knob in a
  circle); or a vertical pan gesture (drag your finger up and down across the knob to
  increase or decrease a setting). This gesture preference is configured in the Settings
  app (not the cpyn app itself).
