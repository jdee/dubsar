        Q. How do I suppress Word of the Day notifications on Android?
      %p
        A. Go to the app&apos;s home page by tapping the
        %em Home
        button in the action bar at the top of the screen, which looks like a house.
        Once on the home page, tap the
        %em Preferences
        button in the action bar, which looks like an array of buttons.
      =image_tag 'android-prefs.png'

      %p
        That will take you to the Preferences view. In the Preferences view, the first
        option is for Word of the day status bar notifications. You can turn them on and
        off with that setting.

        Q. Are there native Dubsar applications for mobile devices?
      A. Dubsar is available for iOS and Android.

      %h2
        Q. How does the HTTP proxy setting work?
      %p
        A. Starting with Jelly Bean, Android supports a global HTTP proxy
        setting for wi-fi connections. (Long press on a wi-fi network in the Settings app
        and select Modify network. Then check Show advanced options to reveal the global
        proxy setting for that network.)
      %p
        To override the global setting, or to use a proxy setting independent of network
        (e.g., for the Guardian Project&apos;s Orbot gateway on the device), use the HTTP proxy
        setting in the Preferences activity. This setting is used both for retrieving data
        from the Dubsar server and for displaying this FAQ in the application. If it is set,
        it overrides any global proxy setting. It does not take effect if you tap any of the
        buttons in the About activity (to visit the Amazon App Store or the Dubsar website,
        e.g.). Those links are handled by your browser app, which can take advantage of a global
        proxy setting.
      %p
        At the moment, there is a known bug. When viewing the FAQ web view on Kit Kat
        (Android 4.4), the application&apos;s HTTP proxy setting is ignored. In order to view
        this FAQ in the app on Kit Kat, use a global proxy setting or connect without a proxy.

        Q. How do I get help with a problem?
      A. Contact
      =link_to 'support@dubsar-dictionary.com', 'mailto:support@dubsar-dictionary.com'
      for support with Dubsar Mobile or a Dubsar app.
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. Where does the database come from?
      A. This is the
      %a{:href => 'http://wordnet.princeton.edu'} WordNet&reg;
      3.0 data set from Princeton University,
      available for free under the
      %a{:href => 'http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/license', :title => 'WordNet 3.0 License'}
        WordNet 3.0 License.
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. Which words are in the dictionary?
      A. The
      %a{:href => 'http://wordnet.princeton.edu'} WordNet&reg;
      data set is aimed at automated text processing and
      includes only the most numerous parts of speech: adjectives,
      adverbs, nouns and verbs.  It does not include conjunctions,
      interjections, prepositions or pronouns.  These words are far fewer
      in number and are less directly related to the meaning of any text.
      So you won't find
      %em from
      in Dubsar, but you will find
      %em
        %a{:href => url_for(:action => :m_show, :id => Word.find_by_name_and_part_of_speech('sedulous', 'adjective').id), :title => 'sedulous'}
          sedulous.
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. What do those WordNet&reg; terms mean?
      A. Some of them are listed here in Dubsar.  The data model used in
      Dubsar's SQLite database uses them for its table names.
      %h3 Word
      A dictionary entry with a unique name and part of speech.

      %h3
        =link_to 'Synset', url_for(:action => :m_show, :id => Word.find_by_name_and_part_of_speech('synset', 'noun').id), :title => 'Synset'
      A list of synonymous words in a particular sense.  Each word can
      belong to multiple synsets.  A synset is essentially a meaning that
      one or more words share.  It includes a gloss and optionally one or
      more sample sentences.

      %h3 Sense
      The intersection (or join table, in database terms) of words and
      synsets.  Each occurrence of one word in one synset is a sense of
      that word.  A sense is a specific meaning of a single word.

      %h3 Pointer
      A lexical or semantic relationship between senses or synsets.  A
      lexical pointer points from one sense to another (one specific
      meaning of one word to a specific meaning of another word).  A
      semantic pointer points from one synset to another and hence
      relates two meanings.  There are many specific pointer types.
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. What's all that stuff listed for each word sense?
      A. The tooltips display a number of things:
      %dl
        %dt lexical file name
        %dd
          broad categories associated with each word sense

        %dt adjective marker
        %dd
          for some adjective senses, a limitation on the syntactic
          position of the adjective when used in this sense (see below)

        %dt frequency count
        %dd
          number of times this word sense occurs in a reference text

        %dt verb frames
        %dd
          generic sentence frames applicable to this verb sense

        %dt sample sentences
        %dd
          sample sentences for the synset

      %h4 Adjective markers
      Some adjective senses may only be used in certain syntactic
      positions:
      %ul
        %li
          %strong (a) attributive
          The
          %em left
          side of the road.
        %li
          %strong (ip) immediately postnominal
          I live in the city
          %em proper.
        %li
          %strong (p) predicate
          It is
          %em well
          he did not go.

      Then there are lexical and semantic pointers from one word sense to
      another sense (for lexical pointers) or synset (for semantic ones).

        Q. How many entries does Dubsar have?
      A. Here are current row counts, by table.  This list is live,
      generated from the database tables whenever you load this page.
      As Dubsar&apos;s data content evolves, this list of tables and their
      specific row counts will change.
      %table
        %tbody
          - %w{synset word sense inflection pointer}.each do |model|
            %tr

      %h2
        Q. How long does it take to build the Dubsar database?
      A. Currently it takes more than three hours.
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. How are the autocompleter results determined?
      %p
        A. All search results use full text searching, similar to the
        behavior of most search engines, against the inflections table.
        All searching is case-insensitive.
        Results include all search terms. An asterisk (*) may be used to
        match any non-whitespace string, including nothing. Certain operators
        may also be used, in all uppercase, like "law OR order." Exact matches
        (results where the matching inflection is exactly the search term as
        it was typed) are sorted to the top. Other results are sorted in ASCII
        order, so all capital letters come before all lowercase letters.

      %p
        The autocompleter results are determined by looking first for an
        exact match, then by searching for
        %em search terms*,
        i.e., appending an
        asterisk to the search terms. So if you type in
        %em frus,
        which has no exact match, you will see the results of searching for
        %em frus*,
        which returns all results containing a term beginning with
        %em frus.

      %p
        Exact matching is case-sensitive, so if you search for
        %em Fruit,
        the word
        %em fruit
        will not appear at the top of the list. In fact, it will not show up in
        the autocompleter at all. If you perform a search for
        %em Fruit, fruit
        will appear sorted in with the rest of the results.

      %h2
        Q. What is OpenSearch?
      A. The OpenSearch protocol allows some supported browsers (Internet
      Explorer, Firefox and Google Chome) to add Dubsar to the
      browser&apos;s list of search engines so that you can search
      Dubsar, complete with live suggestions, from your browser&apos;s
      search box.
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. How does full text searching work?
      %p
        A. Dubsar searches now work similarly to most search engines.
      %ul
        %li All searching is case-insensitive.
        %li Search results will include anything that contains all search terms.
        %li
          An asterisk (*) stands for any non-whitespace string (including nothing).
          So searching for
          %em count*
          matches anything containing a discrete term that begins with
          %em count.
        %li
          Certain operators are recognized in all caps (e.g.,
          %em law OR order
          ).
        %li
          Results are sorted in ASCII order, with all capital letters coming before all
          lower-case letters. But case-sensitive exact matches (including inflections)
          are sorted to the top.
