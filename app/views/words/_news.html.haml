    Version 1.2.1 of Dubsar for Android has been released to Google Play and the
    Amazon App Store. Please see the
    =link_to 'home page', root_path
    for links to both.
  %p
    Dubsar now tweets the word of the day on Twitter each day, with an app card and
    a deep link that takes you directly to the word of the day in the mobile app on
    your iOS or Google Play device (Android 3.0 or later). Follow
    = link_to '@dubsar', 'https://twitter.com/intent/follow?user_id=335105958', target: '_blank'
    for updates.
  %p
    Dubsar has moved to a new server and a new domain, dubsar.info.
    The old domain, dubsar-dictionary.com, will continue to function for a while,
    redirecting to the new domain. Eventually, dubsar-dictionary.com will be
    retired. Please update any bookmarks.
  %p
    The main Dubsar website has been rewritten to be more mobile friendly. The old
    Dubsar mobile website has been retired. And there was much rejoicing.
  %p
    The Dubsar website has a new feature that has been available in the iOS app since
    September: synset searching. You can now search for synsets whose glosses or
    sample sentences match your search text, rather than searching for matching words.
  %p
    Sense views have been replaced with contextual synset views. Now you can see lexical
    content within a synset view by tapping any of the synonyms in the synset view.
  %p
    Watch this space for information about continued changes to the application suite.
