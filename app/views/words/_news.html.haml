      Dubsar is nearing launch.  Once the full
      %a{:href => 'http://wordnet.princeton.edu/', :title => 'WordNet(R)'}
        WordNet&reg;
      content is available in the application, it will be ready.
    %li
      Dubsar now shows alternate forms for many words and will accept
      searches for inflected forms.  For example, if you search for
      %em looks,
      you will find both
      %em look (n.)
      and
      %em look (v.).
      (Note that this new content may be a little buggy.  You may find
      some incorrect inflections listed.  They will gradually be
      cleaned up.  Thanks for your patience.)
    %li
      Dubsar is no longer tracking hit counts but ranks words according
      to their frequency counts in the
      %a{:href => 'http://wordnet.princeton.edu/', :title => 'WordNet(R)'}
        WordNet&reg;
      database.  The autocompleter now always completes the top ten
      results (if that many are available) as you type, even for a
      single letter.  This means it always suggests the most common
      words first.
