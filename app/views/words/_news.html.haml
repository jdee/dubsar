      Dubsar was officially launched November 14, 2010.
    %li
      The entire content of
      %a{:href => 'http://wordnet.princeton.edu', :title => 'WordNetÂ®'}
        WordNet&reg;
      is now available in the application.

      =link_to 'Dubsar on Facebook,', 'http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dubsar/155561501154946', :title => 'Dubsar on Facebook'
      but Dubsar will not use Facebook&apos;s widgets again until they
      are free of tracking cookies.
    %li
      Dubsar now supports the OpenSearch protocol and can be added to
      your browser&apos;s list of search engines.
    %li
      Look for a mobile edition of Dubsar in 2011. In preparation for
      the project, the Dubsar team has to procure a better mobile
      device, but he&apos;s not allowed to buy himself anything till
      after Christmas.  Happy Holidays!
