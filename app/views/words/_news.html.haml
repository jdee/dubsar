      Dubsar has improved navigation among words, senses and synsets,
      along with a number of view improvements to the main and mobile
      sites.
    %li
      Dubsar now has a share link that brings up a dialog with a
      number of options for sharing with social networks. Through the
      magic of AJAX, the main Dubsar site includes no externally-hosted
      material until you click the &quot;share&quot; link, speeding
      page loads and protecting your privacy.
    %li
      Look for applications for iPhone and Android in the summer of
      2011.
    %li
      Dubsar is undergoing a number of changes over the next few weeks,
      some visible, some not. The site may not be as reliable as usual.
      If it seems to be down, don&apos;t fret. It will be back up soon.
    %li
      Watch this space for information about continued changes to the
      site.
