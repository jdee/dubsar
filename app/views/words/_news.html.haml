      The main Dubsar website has been rewritten to be more mobile friendly. The old
      Dubsar mobile website has been retired. And there was much rejoicing.
    %li
      The Dubsar website has a new feature that has been available in the iOS app since
      September: synset searching. You can now search for synsets whose glosses or
      sample sentences match your search text, rather than searching for matching words.
    %li
      Sense views have been replaced with contextual synset views. Now you can see lexical
      content within a synset view by tapping any of the synonyms in the synset view.
    %li
      Dubsar for iOS has a new sibling, an audio player app by the same author called
      cpyn, v. /spɪn/ past tense cpÿn /spʌn/. You can find
      =link_to 'version 1.2.1 of cpyn', 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cpyn/id929721548?mt=8'
      on the iOS App Store. cpyn includes a three-dimensional turntable, reversible
      playback and record scratching, as well as an array of audio features from
      equalization to cross fading and autolevel.
    %li
      =link_to 'Dubsar 2.0.1 for iOS,', 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dubsar/id453868483?mt=8'
      rewritten in Swift, has been released to the App Store. The new version is smaller with
      an offline option and features synset search, bookmarks, autocorrection, themes and
      support for Dynamic Type.
