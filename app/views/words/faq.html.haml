      Q. Where does the database come from?
  #pane_1
    A. This is the WordNet&reg; 3.0 data set from Princeton University,
    available for free under the WordNet 3.0 License.
  %h2#faq_2
    %a{:href => '#faq_2'}
      Q. Which words are in the dictionary?
  #pane_2
    A. The WordNet&reg; data set is aimed at automated text processing and
    includes only the most numerous parts of speech: adjectives,
    adverbs, nouns and verbs.  It does not include conjunctions,
    interjections, prepositions or pronouns.  These words are far fewer
    in number and are less directly related to the meaning of any text.
    So you won't find
    %em from
    in Dubsar, but you will find
    %em
      %a{:href => url_for(:action => :show, :term => 'sedulous'), :title => 'sedulous'}
        sedulous.
  %h2#faq_3
    %a{:href => '#faq_3'}
      Q. Which browsers work well with Dubsar?
  #pane_3
    A. Thanks to jQuery, nearly any browser that supports JavaScript
    will display Dubsar well, particularly:
    %ul
      %li
        Firefox 3 on all tested platforms (Ubuntu Linux, Mac OS X,
        Windows Vista)
      %li Google Chrome 6 &amp; 7 on all platforms
      %li Safari 5 on OS X and Vista
      %li Camino 2 on OS X
      %li OmniWeb 5 on OS X
      %li Internet Explorer 8 on Vista

    Dubsar works in the following browsers, but with significant styling
    glitches.
    %ul
      %li Opera 10 on all platforms
      %li Konqueror 4 on Ubuntu Linux
    The
    =link_to 'QUnit test suite', qunit_path, :title => 'QUnit'
    currently passes in all tested browsers.
  %h2#faq_4
    %a{:href => '#faq_4'}
      Q. What are SQL wild cards?
  #pane_4
    A. The Structured Query Language used by Dubsar&apos;s
    PostgreSQL database accepts the following wildcards in
    searches:
    %ul
      %li % matches anything, including nothing at all
      %li _ matches any single character
    For example:
    %ul
      %li
        ="%count% matches all words containing"
        %em count
      %li
        c_t matches
        %em cat, cot
        and
        %em cut
  %h2#faq_5
    %a{:href => '#faq_5'}
      Q. What do those WordNet&reg; terms mean?
  #pane_5
    A. Some of them are listed here in Dubsar.  The data model used in
    Dubsar's PostgreSQL database uses them for its table names.
    %dl
      %dt Word
      %dd
        A dictionary entry with a unique name and part of speech.

      %dt
        =link_to 'Synset', url_for(:action => :show, :term => 'synset'), :title => 'Synset'
      %dd A list of synonymous words in a particular sense.  Each word
      can belong to multiple synsets.  A synset is essentially a
      meaning that one or more words share.

      %dt Sense
      %dd The intersection (or join model, in database terms) of words
      and synsets.  Each occurrence of one word in one synset is a
      sense of that word.  A sense is a specific meaning of a single
      word.

      %dt Pointers
      %dd Lexical and semantic relationships among senses and synsets.
      A lexical pointer points from one sense to another (one specific
      meaning of one word to a specific meaning of another word).  A
      semantic pointer points from one synset to another and hence
      relates two meanings.  There are many specific pointer types.
  %h2#faq_6
    %a{:href => '#faq_6'}
      Q. What's all that stuff in the tooltips?
  #pane_6
    A. Those are lexical and semantic pointers from one word sense to
    another sense (for lexical pointers) or synset (for semantic ones).
