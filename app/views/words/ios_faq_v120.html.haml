        Q. How do I turn off word of the day push notifications?
      %p
        A. This method works for push notifications from any iOS application on an iPad,
        iPhone or iPod touch. Open the Settings app from the
        device&apos;s home screen. Tap Notifications on the master panel (iPad) or
        the main view of the Settings app (iPhone/iPod touch). Scroll down to see a
        list of apps &quot;In Notification Center.&quot; Tap the row for Dubsar.
        This will take you to a screen with a number of push-notification-related
        settings for Dubsar. Unfortunately, there is no master switch to turn off
        notifications altogether. You have to disable all the aspects independently
        on this screen. When you are done, it should look like this (the iPad view
        is similar):
      %h3 Dubsar with all notifications disabled
      = image_tag 'dubsar-notifications.png', alt: 'Dubsar Notifications', width: 300, height: 532, style: 'display: block;'
      %p
        When you have set the
        %em Notification Center, Badge App Icon, Sounds
        and
        %em View In Lock Screen
        switches to OFF and set the
        %em Alert Style
        to None, tap the back
        button in the navigation bar at the top, which says, &quot;Notifications.&quot;
        This will return you to the general Notifications settings. At the bottom, under
        Not In Notification Center, you&apos;ll see Dubsar:
      %h3 Dubsar no longer in Notification Center
      = image_tag 'notifications.png', alt: 'Dubsar not in Notification Center', width: 300, height: 532, style: 'display: block;'
      %p
        You can do the same for any application in the Notification Center. Of course,
        you can also fine-tune the settings for each application there, choosing which
        sort of notification, if any, you wish to receive, whether you want a badge on
        the app and whether it should play a sound when a notification arrives.
      %p
        If you originally said no when asked if the app could send push notifications
        but later change your mind, you can use the settings above to enable notifications
        from Dubsar. You can also do this after you&apos;ve removed Dubsar from the
        Notification Center, as described above.

      %h2
        Q. How do the previews work?
      %p
        A. Dubsar's views reflect the structure of WordNet&reg;, but often, in previous
        versions, you would have to tap through a couple of empty views in order to get
        to the information you wanted. That's because the Search and Word views are just
        lists of things: search results and word senses. Now Dubsar shows you a preview
        of the following view for the first item in each list.
      %p
        For example, search for onomatopoeia. You'll get back a view like this:
 
      =image_tag 'onomatopoeia-1.png', :size => '240x426'

      %p
        This view includes a preview. To hide the preview, tap the Hide button at the
        right of the bottom toolbar. When the preview goes away, you'll see this:

      =image_tag 'onomatopoeia-2.png', :size => '240x426'

      %p
        This was previously the only content of this Search view. Having found
        the one word matching your search, you had to tap ahead to the Word view in
        order to see more. Now you'll see this in the Word view:

      =image_tag 'onomatopoeia-3.png', :size => '240x426'

      %p
        Again, this view contains a preview. If you tap Hide again, you'll see:

      =image_tag 'onomatopoeia-4.png', :size => '240x426'

      %p
        Before the introduction of previews, this was all you'd see in this Word view,
        a single sense. Tapping once again on that row, you'll finally come to the
        Sense view:

      =image_tag 'onomatopoeia-5.png', :size => '240x426'

      %p
        This is just what was previewed in the previous two views, but you didn't have
        to tap through two empty views to see this information, as you did in Dubsar
        1.1.1 and earlier. Note that in the Search view, you get a preview of the first
        Word view in the search results, and that preview in turn includes a preview
        of the first Sense in that Word view, just as you see in the full Word view if
        you tap on the first row of the search results.

      %p
        Sometimes you are interested in a long list. Search for something like
        %em take.
        If you hide the preview in the search view, you'll see many matches. Take is
        primarily a verb, so 
        =link_to 'take (v.)', 'dubsar:///words/145841'
        has a higher frequency count than other parts of speech and is displayed as
        the first result. (Search results are displayed with exact matches at the top,
        followed by fulltext matches. Exact matches, if there is more than one, are
        sorted by frequency count.) But maybe you're interested in
        =link_to 'take (n.)', 'dubsar:///words/32773'
        or one of the other matches. Hide the preview to see them. Similarly in the
        Word view, you can always hide the preview to show the rest of the senses of
        the word.

        Q. Which versions of iOS are supported?
      A. Version 1.1.0 and earlier require version 4.2 or higher of iOS.
      Version 1.1.1 and later require version 4.3 or higher.
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. How do I get help with a problem?
      A. Contact
      =link_to 'support@dubsar-dictionary.com', 'mailto:support@dubsar-dictionary.com'
      for support with Dubsar for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad.
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. Where does the database come from?
      A. This is the WordNet&reg; 3.0 data set from Princeton University,
      available for free under the WordNet 3.0 License.
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. Which words are in the dictionary?
      A. The
      WordNet&reg;
      data set is aimed at automated text processing and
      includes only the most numerous parts of speech: adjectives,
      adverbs, nouns and verbs.  It does not include conjunctions,
      interjections, prepositions or pronouns.  These words are far fewer
      in number and are less directly related to the meaning of any text.
      So you won't find
      %em from
      in Dubsar, but you will find
      =link_to 'sedulous.', 'dubsar:///words/6171'
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. What do those WordNet&reg; terms mean?
      A. Some of them are listed here in Dubsar.  The data model used in
      Dubsar's SQLite database uses them for its table names.
      %h3 Word
      A dictionary entry with a unique name and part of speech.

      %h3
      =link_to 'Synset', 'dubsar:///words/89098'
      A list of synonymous words in a particular sense.  Each word can
      belong to multiple synsets.  A synset is essentially a meaning that
      one or more words share.  It includes a gloss and optionally one or
      more sample sentences.

      %h3 Sense
      The intersection (or join table, in database terms) of words and
      synsets.  Each occurrence of one word in one synset is a sense of
      that word.  A sense is a specific meaning of a single word.

      %h3 Pointer
      A lexical or semantic relationship between senses or synsets.  A
      lexical pointer points from one sense to another (one specific
      meaning of one word to a specific meaning of another word).  A
      semantic pointer points from one synset to another and hence
      relates two meanings.  There are many specific pointer types.
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. What's all that stuff listed for each word sense?
      A. The tooltips display a number of things:
      %dl
        %dt lexical file name
        %dd
          broad categories associated with each word sense

        %dt adjective marker
        %dd
          for some adjective senses, a limitation on the syntactic
          position of the adjective when used in this sense (see below)

        %dt frequency count
        %dd
          number of times this word sense occurs in a reference text

        %dt verb frames
        %dd
          generic sentence frames applicable to this verb sense

        %dt sample sentences
        %dd
          sample sentences for the synset

      %h4 Adjective markers
      Some adjective senses may only be used in certain syntactic
      positions:
      %ul
        %li
          %strong (a) attributive
          The
          %em left
          side of the road.
        %li
          %strong (ip) immediately postnominal
          I live in the city
          %em proper.
        %li
          %strong (p) predicate
          It is
          %em well
          he did not go.

      Then there are lexical and semantic pointers from one word sense to
      another sense (for lexical pointers) or synset (for semantic ones).

        Q. How many entries does Dubsar have?
      A. Here are current row counts, by table.  This list is live,
      generated from the database tables whenever you load this page.
      As Dubsar&apos;s data content evolves, this list of tables and their
      specific row counts will change.
      %table
        %tbody
          - %w{synset word sense inflection pointer}.each do |model|
            %tr
              %td
                =model_count(model)
              %td
                =model.pluralize
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. How long does it take to build the Dubsar database?
      A. Currently it takes more than three hours.
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. How are the autocompleter results determined?
      %p
        A. All search results use full text searching, similar to the
        behavior of most search engines, against the inflections table.
        All searching is case-insensitive.
        Results include all search terms. An asterisk (*) may be used to
        match any non-whitespace string, including nothing. Certain operators
        may also be used, in all uppercase, like "law OR order." Exact matches
        (results where the matching inflection is exactly the search term as
        it was typed) are sorted to the top. Other results are sorted in ASCII
        order, so all capital letters come before all lowercase letters.

      %p
        The autocompleter results are determined by looking first for an
        exact match, then by searching for
        %em search terms*,
        i.e., appending an
        asterisk to the search terms. So if you type in
        %em frus,
        which has no exact match, you will see the results of searching for
        %em frus*,
        which returns all results containing a term beginning with
        %em frus.

      %p
        Exact matching is case-sensitive, so if you search for
        %em Fruit,
        the word
        %em fruit
        will not appear at the top of the list. In fact, it will not show up in
        the autocompleter at all. If you perform a search for
        %em Fruit, fruit
        will appear sorted in with the rest of the results.
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. Can I do wild-card searches?
      %p
        A. Yes. Full text searching recognizes the asterisk (*) character, which
        will match any non-whitespace string, including the empty string.
      %p
        If more than 30 results are returned, the list is paginated using a page
        control like this:
      %p
        =image_tag 'ios_page_control.png', :height => "147", :width => "300", :alt => "iOS page control"
      %p
        Tap the left side of the control to page back and the right side to
        page forward through the search results.
      %p
        The iPad app provides some built-in wild-card searches using the alphabet
        buttons on the master panel.
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. Can I get more room to see a gloss in a Sense or Synset view?
      %p
        A. Yes. The pale blue banner label below each gloss, listing a WordNet&reg;
        lexname like &lt;noun.substance&gt;, can be dragged down to give the gloss
        more room, if needed. A gold drag handle will appear if you apply pressure
        to the label:
      %p
        =image_tag 'ios_drag_handle.png', :height => "173", :width => "300", :alt => "iOS drag handle"
      %p
        This is available in Sense and Synset views on both the iPhone and iPad.

      %h2
        Q. What does Dubsar mean?
      A. Dubsar is the Sumerian word for scribe.
    %div{'data-role' => 'collapsible', 'data-collapsed' => 'true'}
      %h2
        Q. How does full text searching work?
      %p
        A. Dubsar searches now work similarly to most search engines.
      %ul
        %li All searching is case-insensitive.
        %li Search results will include anything that contains all search terms.
        %li
          An asterisk (*) stands for any non-whitespace string (including nothing).
          So searching for
          %em count*
          matches anything containing a discrete term that begins with
          %em count.
        %li
          Certain operators are recognized in all caps (e.g.,
          %em law OR order
          ).
        %li
          Results are sorted in ASCII order, with all capital letters coming before all
          lower-case letters. But case-sensitive exact matches (including inflections)
          are sorted to the top.
